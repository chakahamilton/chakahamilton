# Chaka Hamilton 🛠️


Hi I’m Chaka I like to break things and make them better.  I am an Inventor, Maker, & Home-brewer.  I have a passion for helping others through technology. In the early 80’s I started  taking things apart, and figuring out how they work. My primary focus  is Assistive technologies, for individuals with physical disabilities. I have Bachelor of Science – BS focused in [Anthropology](https://www.adelphi.edu/program/undergraduate/anthropology/) from [Adelphi University.](https://www.adelphi.edu/)

for over 20 years I worked in the Telecommunications field. First as a [Telecom Analyst](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Telecommunications_Analyst/)
, then as a [Centrex administrator](https://www.ringover.com/blog/centrex-definition-advantages)
. In that time it was hard not to explore more of the industry, I setup my own VOIP system in my home, and also made a portable VoiP Briefcase solution. I called it a WIBIC (Wireless Broadband Internet Communicator). 


8 years ago, I started brewing beer, and that then turned into another hobby of building brewing rigs. I’ve found that most Home-brewers are also makers. 

In late 2017 I was diagnosed with [squamous cell carcinoma](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/types/squamous-cell-carcinoma/) While fighting that battle and winning at it, I came up with several Ideas that would help people in my situation. The projects you’ll see in my Github are the results of those ideas.
